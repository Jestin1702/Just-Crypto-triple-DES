# Just-Crypto-triple-DES
It is an file encryption developed using python and uses triple des algorithm.
It has a GUI interface to add files to Encrypt and decrypt.
You have to enter both file name and extension while encryption and decryption. 
This is used for additional security. Like you encrypt a jpg it will still be an jpg but encrypted and anyone may be able to crack it. 
But by changing the original extention the hacker wont be able to find the original file extention. If you dont provide an extenstion it be txt file by default.
You have to use thesame key(Password) for both Encryption and Decryption. 
To run the file execute main.py
